          of Andre Igoudala in the closing minutes of Game 7 of the 2016 NBA
          Finals is one of the most iconic moments in NBA history. The moment
          capped off the Cavs comeback from down 3-1 against the 73-9 Warriors,
          which made them the only team to ever come back from a 3-1 deficit in

          huge performances, and allowed him to finally bring a title to

          Celtics, one of James' long time rivals, in Game 6 of the Eastern

          show two years after bringing 3 All-Stars together. With the pressure
          on, James had a monster performance, which pushed the series to a Game
          7 back in Miami. The Heat would go on to win Game 7 and the

          due to an injury, Jordan made sure that the Bulls finished out their
          second three-peat with a 45 point performance in Game 6, including the

          Jordan’s Bulls took on John Stockon, Karl Malone, and the Utah Jazz in

          participate in practice and was in a dark locker room vomiting.
          However, he told Coach Phil Jackson he could play, and ended up
          playing 44 minutes and dropping 38 points, with 15 in the fourth
          quarter, in a win that sent the series back to Chicago with the Bulls
          up 3-2. The Flu Game is by far the most iconic and memorable playoff

          In his early years, Jordan faced some tough teams in the Eastern
          Conference. One such team was the 1986 Boston Celtics, featuring
          3-time MVP Larry Bird. MJ and the Bulls ran into the Celtics in the
          first round of the 1986 playoffs. In Game 2, MJ dropped 63 points in a
          double-overtime loss, which broke Elgin Baylor’s 24-year-old record
          for the most points in a playoff game. After the game, Larry Bird said
