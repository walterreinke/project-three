          individual performances in the playoffs. In this list, you will find

          Luka Doncic's Historic Game Winner
        </h1>
        <p class="white">
          Doncic's performance in Game 4 of the Western First Round in 2020
          broke so many records that it's impossible to list them all here, so
          you can find them here instead. His OT buzzer beater against the
          Clippers capped off a 21 point comeback for the Mavs, the largest in
          franchise postseason history. His monster triple-double made him only
          the ninth player to ever record consecutive triples doubles in the
          playoffs, and only the third at the age of 21 or younger.

          LeBron James brings the Cavs back from down 3-1 in the Finals
        </h1>
        <p class="white">
          James' chasedown block of Andre Igoudala in the closing minutes of
          Game 7 of the 2016 NBA Finals is one of the most iconic moments in NBA
          history. The moment capped off the Cavs comeback from down 3-1 against
          the 73-9 Warriors, which made them the only team to ever come back
          from a 3-1 deficit in the Finals. James' triple-double in Game 7 also
          capped off a series of huge performances, and allowed him to finally
          bring a title to Cleveland.

          LeBron's Best Playoff Game Ever?
        </h1>
        <p class="white">
          In 2012, two years into the "Big 3" era in Miami, the Heat still
          hadn't won a championship. And now, they were facing elimination to
          the Boston Celtics, one of James' long time rivals, in Game 6 of the
          Eastern Conference Finals. If the Heat lost here, they would have
          nothing to show two years after bringing 3 All-Stars together. With
          the pressure on, James had a monster performance, scoring 45 points
          and grabbing 15 rebounds, pushing the series to a Game 7 back in
          Miami. The Heat would go on to win Game 7 and the championship, James’
          first. This game is considered the greatest of James’ career by many.

          A Young LeBron Carries the Cavs through Double Overtime
        </h1>
        <p class="white">
          In 2007, at age 22, in just his second ever postseason, LeBron James
          led the Cavs to the Eastern Conference Finals against the Detroit
          Pistons, who were in their fifth consecutive Conference Finals and
          were only 2 years removed from winning a championship. In Game 5, with
          6:14 left in regulation, the Cavaliers were up 79-78. Through the end
          of regulation and both overtimes, James scored 29 of the Cav’s final
          30 points, including the team’s last 25 points, to lead them to
          victory. The Cavs would go on to win Game 6 and make it to their first
          Finals in franchise history, which was also the first Finals
          appearance of many for James.

          Allen Iverson upsets the Kobe and Shaq led Lakers

        <p class="white">
          When reigning MVP AI and the ragtag Sixers went up against the
          powerhouse Lakers in the 2001 Finals, everybody thought that it would
          be a fast and easy sweep for the Lakers. That is, everybody not named
          Allen Iverson. The Lakers had reached the Finals with an 11-0 record,
          sweeping all three teams they faced in the Western Conference
          Playoffs. They would have ended with a perfect record in the
          postseason if not for AI’s monster performance in Game 1 of the
          Finals, where he played all but three seconds of the overtime victory.
          Even though the Sixers would go on to lose the series, Game 1 showed
          that AI was truly the MVP and also produced one of the most iconic
          moments in NBA history (link).

          Michael Jordan’s “Last Shot”
        </h1>
        <p class="white">
          MJ is one the greatest players to ever touch a basketball. He won two
          different three-peats with the Bulls, totaling to six titles in eight
          years. 1998 was the culmination of the second three-peat for Jordan
          and the Bulls, and they had to face a tough Utah Jazz team in the
          Finals. With Scottie Pippen, Jordan’s all-time great sidekick, barely
          able to move due to an injury, Jordan made sure that the Bulls
          finished out their second three-peat with a 45 point performance in
          Game 6, including the iconic game winning shot (link) over Byron
          Russel. Whild Jordan would play again for the Washington Wizards in
          the early 2000s, this shot was the culmination of an era of basketball
          dominated by MJ.

          A performance so iconic that it needs no other introduction. In 1997,
          Jordan’s Bulls on John Stockon, Karl Malone, and the Utah Jazz in the
          Finals. In the hours leading up to Game 5, Jordan did not participate
          in practice and was in a dark locker room vomiting. However, he told
          Coach Phil Jackson he could play, and ended up playing 44 minutes and
          dropping 38, with 15 in the fourth quarter, in a win that sent the
          series back to Chicago with the Bulls up 3-2. The Flu Game is by far
          the most iconic and memorable playoff performance in NBA history.

        <p class="white">
          Before winning six rings in eight years, Michael Jordan was tasked
          with dragging the abysmal Bulls team that drafted him through an
          Eastern Conference that was made up of some all-time great teams. One
          such team was the 1986 Boston Celtics, featuring 3-time MVP Larry
          Bird. MJ and Bulls ran into the Celtics in the first round of the 1986
          playoffs. In Game 2, MJ dropped 63 points in a double-overtime loss,
          which broke Elgin Baylor’s 24-year-old record for most points in a
          playoff, and is a record that still stands today. After the game,
          Larry Bird said that MJ was the greatest player he had ever seen and
          called him “God disguised as Michael Jordan.”

          Magic Johnson Wins Finals MVP as a Rookie

        <p class="white">
          While Magic Johnson played point guard, he was incredibly tall,
          standing at 6’9”. This came in handy for Game 6 of the 1980 NBA
          Finals, where Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and the Lakers were in the
          midst of taking on the Philadelphia 76ers. With Abdul-Jabbar out due
          to an ankle injury, Johnson began the game at center but played every
          position throughout the game and led the Lakers to a 123-107 victory,
          winning them the title, their seventh in franchise history. Johnson’s
          performance earned him Final MVP, making him the only rookie in NBA
          history to earn such an honor.

          Bill Russell Stuffs the Stat Sheet
        </h1>
        <p class="white">
          Bill Russell is the winningest player in NBA history, having won 11
          championships with the Boston Celtics. He is also responsible for some
          of the most eye-popping performances in NBA playoff history. His most
          dazzling performance was in Game 7 of the 1962 NBA Finals, where his
          Celtics took on the Lakers. He played every minute of the game,
          including overtime, and finished with 30 points and 40 rebounds. Since
          blocks weren’t recorded in thoses days of the NBA, we can only imagine
          how many he had if he pulled down 40 rebounds. Russell’s performance
          clinched Boston’s fourth straight championship, and the fifth in
          franchise history. Russell and the Celtics would go on to face the
          Lakers in the Finals five more times throughout the 1960s, and Boston
          would win each time.
