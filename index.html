        </h1>
        <p class="boxed big-space">
          The NBA playoffs is where the best players truly shine. Legends are
          made in the postseason. Throughout the history of the NBA, some of the
          best players to ever step on the court have had all-time great
          individual performances in the playoffs. In this list, you will find
          10 of the best individual performances in NBA playoff history, from
          most recent to oldest.

          Luka Doncic's Historic Game Winner
        </h1>
        <p class="white centered">
          Doncic's performance in Game 4 of the Western First Round in 2020
          broke so many records that it's impossible to list them all here, so
          you can find them here instead. His OT buzzer beater against the
          Clippers capped off a 21 point comeback for the Mavs, the largest in
          franchise postseason history. His monster triple-double made him only
          the ninth player to ever record consecutive triples doubles in the
          playoffs, and only the third at the age of 21 or younger.

          LeBron James brings the Cavs back from down 3-1 in the Finals
        </h1>
        <p class="white centered">
          James' chasedown block of Andre Igoudala in the closing minutes of
          Game 7 of the 2016 NBA Finals is one of the most iconic moments in NBA
          history. The moment capped off the Cavs comeback from down 3-1 against
          the 73-9 Warriors, which made them the only team to ever come back
          from a 3-1 deficit in the Finals. James' triple-double in Game 7 also
          capped off a series of huge performances, and allowed him to finally
          bring a title to Cleveland.

          LeBron's Best Playoff Game Ever?
        </h1>
        <p class="white centered">
          In 2012, two years into the "Big 3" era in Miami, the Heat still
          hadn't won a championship. And now, they were facing elimination to
          the Boston Celtics, one of James' long time rivals, in Game 6 of the
          Eastern Conference Finals. If the Heat lost here, they would have
          nothing to show two years after bringing 3 All-Stars together. With
          the pressure on, James had a monster performance, scoring 45 points
          and grabbing 15 rebounds, pushing the series to a Game 7 back in
          Miami. The Heat would go on to win Game 7 and the championship, James’
          first. This game is considered the greatest of James’ career by many.
